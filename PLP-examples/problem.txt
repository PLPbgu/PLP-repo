#COMMENTS:
	1. Add objects for the following predicates:
		- (at ?par)
		- (connected ?par1 ?par2 ?par3)
	2. As confirmed with the user - assumes the following is true in the initial state (no need to mention them):
		- [begin_Aspeed = 0] @ walk_through_gateway
		- [begin_Lspeed = 0] @ walk_through_gateway
		- [arm_moving = FALSE] @ walk_through_gateway
		- [begin_Aspeed = 0] @ observe_gateway
		- [begin_Lspeed = 0] @ observe_gateway
		- [arm_moving = FALSE] @ observe_gateway
